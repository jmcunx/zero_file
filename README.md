## zerof - overwrite a file with selected characters

**Note:** Starting October 12 2023, Microsoft GitHub is forcing
me to use my 2FA access to my repositories via my Cell Phone
or some proprietary application.  So updates to this project
will no longer occur on GitHub.  Updates can be downloaded
from my gemini capsule:

* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi
* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi (mirror)

[See gemini wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)#Software) for clients.

This is a little utility created a while
ago for systems without dd.  All it does
is overwrite an existing file with a character
of your choice (or random data).

This should **not** be used on
[Solid-state drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)
or similar drives.
If used, I doubt it will really clear the empty space.

Not sure if this will overwrite data on some Modern File Systems.

[j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) is an **optional** dependency.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, but this seems to be good enough for me.

**To compile:**
* If "DESTDIR" is not set, will install under /usr/local
* Execute ./build.sh to create a Makefile
* Works on Linux, BSD and AIX

_To uninstall_, execute
"make uninstall"
from the source directory
